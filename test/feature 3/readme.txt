I am trying to implement multiple shooting for solving odes more robust.
I follow this reference:
F. Hamilton,
“Parameter estimation in differential equations: A numerical study of shooting methods,”
SIAM Undergraduate Research Online, 2011.


difference is: i observe not only one species but all. (they say only x)
